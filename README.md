# osu!js-lazer
 An osu! client & framework written entirely in scratch.
 
 ## Status
 
 The game has been recently completely rewritten from scratch, new framework and all, hence the **"v2"** in the project name.
 So keep in mind that this project currently under **heavy development!** It also lacks any gameplay for the time being.
 (This project is in no way trying to replace the original game. osu! is (C) peppy/team osu!)
 
 ## Running osu!js

 | [Windows 7+ (x64)](https://github.com/TheEggo58/osujs-lazer/releases/download/Release/install.exe) | [Other OS's (HTML)](https://github.com/TheEggo58/osujs-lazer/releases/download/Release/osujs-lazer-v2.html) |

 If your platform is not listed above, there is still a chance you can manually build it by following the instructions below.
 
 1. For non-windows operating systems, use the provided link instead. However, this will run in your browser (html) instead of an executable.
 
 2. If you're on Linux, you may try running this via "Wine", however as tested by me this tends to be VERY unstable and laggy. So it's highly unrecommended.
 
 ## Developing osu!js
 
 (osu!js-lazer is currently not open-source YET. We're planning on making this dream a reality and release the source-code to the public!)
 
 - A modified scratch editor with the ability to remove limits and adjust the "stage size" (1280x720)
 (Preferably Turbowarp, use the editing ready link provided here - https://www.turbowarp.org/editor?size=1280x720&clones=Infinity&offscreen&limitless&fps=60)
 - Browser with support for WebGL 2.0.

 ## Compiling osu!js
 
 Use this website here - https://packager.turbowarp.org
 
 - Select the "osu!js-lazer.sb3" file, click "load project".
 - Set the runtime options to: Framerate: 60, Infinite Clones: On, Remove Fencing: On, Remove Miscellaneous Limits: On, Stage Size: 1280 x 720.
 - Set the player options to: Start project automatically: On, Input: No cursor.
 - Leave anything unlisted "off", unless it's required by the changes you specifically have made.
